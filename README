I've got a new Paperwhite 2 and I can't wait to do nasty things to that poor device.
Therefore I made this addon that should make the Kindle as brick-proof as possible.

It is called Coward's Rescue Pack Addon and it should be installed after ixtab's Rescue Pack ( http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=195670 ).

Its purpose is simple - whenever a USB power connection is detected during boot, the Kindle reboots in diags mode.
The probe is done as early as possible and does not require the userstore to be up/sane.
The downside is you will get to diags if you forget yourself and reboot while the device is charging.


If you ever do that inadvertently and can't access the device over SSH, the easiest way to reboot into the main system is to ask nicely ;).
By which I mean:

1. Tap on "S) Device settings"
2. Tap on "X) Exit"
3. Tap on "D) Exit, Reboot or Disable diags"
4. Tap on "D) Disable diagnostics"
5. Tap on "Q) To continue"

Steps 1 and 2 are only needed once, you can safely skip to step 3 on subsequent diags boot.


To do the same over SSH, see the RescuePack README ;).
